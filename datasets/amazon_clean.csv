This shaver is totally worthless. It gives an uneven shave, for one thing; you have to go over the same spots several times to get enough of the hairs evenly trimmed. Also, if you have a thick beard, be prepared to continuously take the plastic guard off after each pass; it doesn't handle a lot of hair well.One other thing to keep in mind if you have a thick beard is to be prepared for the possibility of shaving it over several sessions. the battery in my unit is worthless. It craps out on me after five minutes, despite an all night charge. This is after a total ownership time measured in a few months, and using it only a few times each month.My advice is to pass this one up and go ahead and spend the money on a real shaver, something like a norelco.

We had a WaterPik at home, but I was away at college and so my mom got me this one. I was overall pleased with it at first; although the pressure is certainly not as great as the WaterPik, I was able to get a satisfying clean feeling at level 7. Note, however, that this was the first time I had used such a device in quite some time and my gums were not prepared for it; I could NOT have used the WaterPik at the highest level without first gradually building up the pressure for a few weeks.I too was disappointed in the size of the reservoir. It is indeed a pain to refill in the middle of a cleaning. Indeed, with the WaterPik I would often go through two full reservoirs, so I often find myself refilling and re-refilling the Conair.Anyway, now it's nearly Christmastime again, and this Conair Interplak water jet has gone south. The water pressure is miniscule on all settings; it doesn't change at all from 1 to 7. It's basically useless now.I would not recommend this product, and I instead recommend that you get the real thing, a WaterPik. My family's has lasted over 10 years.",0,personal care,oral hygiene

My drugstore was out of the product so I purchased Surgi-Wax.Before using, I read all of the directions carefully. I microwaved the product, checking it at 15 second intervals, as directed. After a total of 45 seconds, a large chunk of the wax at the top was still very solid, but it was soft underneath. When I attempted the stir the container, the large chunk at the top of the container splashed down into the very hot wax underneath. As a result, the hot wax flew all over me, my sweater and my kitchen.What a mess! I received burns to my right thumb and left index finger which may or may not need medical attention -- it's too soon to tell. In addition, my sweater was ruined by the five-inch trail of wax encrusted on it. After much scrubbing, the surface of the kitchen is finally wax free.I'm a well-educated, reasonable adult...really!

B00006K0X1,Philips Norelco 8825XL Spectra Rechargeable Cord/Cordless Men's Shaving System,A3J7WTODWQH0WQ,55/68,0,1114992000,"Philips Norelco 8825XL Spectra Rechargeable Cord/Cordless Men's Shaving System. I sent this to Norelco and asked that it be passed on to the engineering and marketing people who created this product.I hate this razor! I used to have a 5814XL that finally died. It was one of many Norelco razors that I have had for over 35 years. When I needed to replace the 5814XL, I bought the 8825XL and after using it for 7 months, have come to despise its ability to provide a close shave. Here are my comments on that deficiency as well as others:1. Even right out of the box, this shaver did not provide as close a shave as the old 5814XL.2. I suspect that in order to make it easy to clean, the cutting mechanism was modified to emphasize chopping the hairs up very finely. In fact, I observe that the debris is indeed smaller than in the 5814XL. Unfortunately it is so small that it falls out of the holes in the cutter heads thereby making a mess in the bathroom. I think this may have compromised the ability of the 8825XL to shave close.3. The removal of the AC-DC converter from the shaver body to the cord is a mistake.4. The cord becomes unwieldy to store especially in the pouch. The converter plug is so heavy, it falls out of any socket that is a bit loose. This is especially a problem when shaving with the cord attached.5. The cord with its huge plug does not coil well. The presence of the plug prevents the cord from being curled into any sort of small ball. In fact, the stiffness and direction of the exit of the cord from the plug prevents the cord from being even closely wound around the plug. This means that the cord and plug have effectively become twice as large.6. Presumably the point of removing the AC-DC converter to the plug was to reduce the size of the shaver body. This was probably due to some styling guys wanting a ""sexy"" shape. The shape is also a problem. The shaver wants to tip over when stored on a shelf on its back. Clearly the engineers noted this and added the two vestigial bumps on the back. That this was an afterthought is clear since the bumps are so small - the result of ensuring that the plastic housing ejected easily from the mold during production.7. The adjustment wheel does not stay in the N position. There is not enough friction to maintain that setting. It constantly wants to move toward the S position.8. The desire to have the head on a hinge has also caused problems. The detent that holds the hinge in the shaver body is not big enough. Sometimes when I open the head to clean it, the spring action of the hinge and the smallness of the detent result in the head actually flipping off of the shaver. Once this resulted in all of the head guts coming out. As a result, I am no longer sure that the cutters are matched up. However, do not attribute the lack of closeness of shave to this happening. It did not shave close even before the head popped off.9. Since you have designed the head to flip open, the plastic cover that protects the head during storage no longer has threefold symmetry. As a result one has to look to see that the cover is oriented correctly. That is really dumb!10. The detents on the protective cover are not strong enough. The cover wants to pop off particularly when you try to put the shaver in the storage pouch.11. The storage pouch that provided is hard to use. It appears to be too small, although I think this would not be the case if the protective head cover were more secure and if the cord coiled more neatly with the huge plug.I have now purchased a Norelco 6863XL. It works really well and I am pleased. Therefore, please note that the combination of marketing and styling has really worked to the detriment of function in your more top-of-the-line shavers.",0,personal care,shaving hair removal

Was there some reason it wasn't reported as required? As a matter of fact when I did call HOMEDICS, their response to me was ""So what do you want from us"". It's not about ""wanting"", it's about safety when these pillows make great gifts for elderly people.

The new 3-ring Smart Touch heads are not as good as the old reliable Lift-and-Cut heads.Why you say? To make the head look like it has more surface area and thus should cut faster, the Norelo engineers reduced the cutting area of the fastest, outer, ring, to squeeze in the two inner, but slower surface speed, rings. In fact the outer ring cutting blades are only 1.00 mm wide as opposted the the 1.75 mm width cutter width in the series 7 Lift-and-Cut heads. The added inner rings actually cause pulling of the beard hairs if you try to shave at the same speed you did with the older models.By the Way, the so-called cleaning system is a big bother and not worth the extra cost.

It seems that the plug came undone and all the water came out! We let the chillo (and the bed) dry and then put water back in it according to the instructions. Aparently, there is some kind of chemical or something in the chillo, because refilling it was to no avail. We could not get it to work at all after that and it looked like a plastic bag filled with water (it never flattened out and ""absorbed"" the water again... and the instructions do not talk at all about refilling it...)I'm sorry I wasted my money on this product and would not recommend it to anyone...",0,health care,pain relievers

And I'm cleaning the thing as stated by the instructions... (and looking at the blade construction itself, cleaning it via running water down from the top wouldn't do any good anyway!)I've so far replaced 3 blades in one week - and I've shaved only 5 times. Earlier models allowed me to go for a MONTH per blade...And if you look closely, there's a blank space at the bottom of the razor that could easily fit the 5th blade for their highly vaunted 5-blade toy.I also removed those vertical wires. Cleaning is easier, but in doing so it became absolutely clear (if it wasn't already) that the purpose OF those wires it to prevent cleaning and make disposing of the blades more frequent.I'm going back to the Mach 3 or even to that single-bladed razor circa 1893 that never needs to be discarded; only resharpened like my kitchen knife set... I've got my own budget problems and the money invested in Schick's new chicanery only suggests they've got more money problems or else they wouldn't be so... unsavory in their approach to get more money out of their customers.

Every space on the board has a Disney picture outlined in the color of the question to be asked. The problem is, there is no blue outlined spaces on the board.

With the tub filled, the mat had to be held down by brute force and a number of times, the hose popped off the mat. It was somewhat massaging but the air bubbles cooled the water to an uncomfortable temperature and the heat setting did not do a whit of difference. the handy suction cup holder to keep the remote out of the water. (who ever would think a tub spa's remote would not handle a dunk in the water?) Well I read the instructions carefully and the remote immediately needed to be dried off and the batteries taken out and dried and the whole thing needs time to dry. The next time I tried it (yes I was determined) I got the whole tub floor wet and pushed down on all 24 or so of those little suction cups and tried it again. Still the same story. As I try to push down on the part of the mat coming up by my feet, the part by my head comes up. I end up having to lie there totally flat while the mat bubbles come up around me cooling my nice hot bath water. the hose pops off yet again and I go to use the remote (which is this time not in the precarious holder) and sick and tired of all the faults already I try to turn it off and the remote doesn't even work.

It straightened my hair fast (only took about 10 minutes) and got it silky smooth. I loved it!Then it broke. The red light wouldn't work, and the plates wouldn't heat up. I kept it going for a while by banging it on the counter to jar the red light, but soon it died for good.Of course, I thought, it was just this particular one. So I went out and bought a new one which worked beautifully - for about 3 months. Then presto, one plate stopped working. Simply wouldn't heat up.OK, I thought.

As an esthetician I would advise against using these sort of products. They basically sand your face off. Please leave microderm and abrasive exfoliation to trained and licensed professionals. I can assure you that I am not just saying this to drum up business.I would much rather have people not do anything to their skin than to use a product like this. You initially see great results because of the aggressiveness of the exfoliation, but believe me, you will pay for it in the long run. The main ingredient in this product is aluminum oxide (also referred to as corundum), which is characteristically known for its hardness, and is typically used as an industrial abrasive in sandpaper and as a component in cutting tools. This material is rated as 9 out of 10 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness, making it second only to diamonds in abrasiveness. You may argue that this is also the same substance use in clinical microdermabrasion procedures, but you need to realize that these procedures can only be preformed by a board certified plastic surgeon, dermatologist, or licensed esthetician trained in microdermabrasion treatment. I see people coming in every day who use these at home kits and products, and they all have the same issue; It worked great at first, then after some time they started to notice that it wasn't working as effectively, so they used it more often and harder.Exfoliation of the skin increases cell turnover and helps prepare the skin for hydration and moisturization when done right. When this process is done more often than necessary, or in an overly aggressive manner, you can end up damaging your skin and causing permanent scar tissue build up and inflammation. People don't seem to realize that there is oil on our face for a reason, it's there to protect and moisturize our skin. When you constantly cleanse and exfoliate your skin, you are doing more harm than good. Over stripping the skin causes irritation, break-outs, and heightened sensitivity that rarely can be reversed. When your skin is constantly bombarded by aggressive exfoliation, it's defense is to build up thicker layers of skin for protection. So please, if you do use this, use extreme caution, don't use it on your face, and do not use it more than once a week, if that.Ask any esthetician, plastic surgeon, or dermatologist out there and they'll tell you the same thing",2,skin care,face

I bought this item for my wife exactly four months ago (9-15-06) and she said it was working well for most of the four months. She had concerns because the electrical cord which attachs to the unit rotates and when it rotated to certain angles, the heat would turn off (as indicated by the green light which is either off, flickers or solid). As she used it, the problem became more and more frequent. Now, the unit will not work unless it is at one point and at a certain angle (which I guess allows electricity to go to the unit). I tried taping it to that location but the cord also has to stay at that certain angle which is impossible to maintain when using the iron. This is not very good for such an expensive item which gets alot of twisting and turning use and should have the highest materials and workmanship to prevent electrical. My wife admits that like anyone the unit has been dropped, but that should not cause an electrical cord problem. Dropping the iron risks breaking the two flat iron ceramic plates, which are still perfectly intact. The problem is that because of the cord, and the way a flat iron is used, there is alot of cord twisting. For what is advertised as a ""professional"" device and at a cost which only a professional would normally purchase, we cannot believe that this could be used in a ""professional"" environment. My wife only uses it six or seven times a week, not six or seven times a day like in a salon. We highly recommend that you STAY AWAY from this product.",2,hair care,styling tools

B00005MF9T,LitterMaid LM500 Automated Litter Box,unknown,16/22,0,1052092800,"LitterMaid LM500 Automated Litter Box. Zero stars isn't an option so I had to give it one star and even that is totally undeserved. My husband thought this was a good idea when we got our 3rd cat. First, the entire unit with the tent attached was too large to fit in the corner where our old litterbox was kept. So we had to place it in our laundry room. The box itself was too small for my 15 & 12 pound cats to use comfortably use. The first few fork passes were great, but when the box became dirty and the litter got wet, the forks clogged and would simply sweep all the wet litter into a clump at the head of the box, so if that was allowed to dry (like it would when we were at work all day) we ended up with a huge rock at one end and almost no litter in the bottom of the box. If there was a lot of wet litter, it would become too heavy and the motor would stop in the middle of a sweep, getting it to work again involved having to clean it completely. The motor was SO noisy that we could hear it go on when we were all the way upstairs, the noise scared our new kitten so much, he refused to use it. Our most mischievious little feline devil discovered what he needed to do to turn the motor on and that became his favorite sport, he'd activate it and watch the rake go back and forth, so the lifespan of the batteries was about 3 days in our house. Our older cat, who's very fastidious, even for a cat, steadfastly refused to use it at all because it smelled. He'd simply go to the spot where the old box used to be and wail. I should point out that the smell was distributed throughout our home when the box was raking. We needed to replace the motor after only 3 weeks because the casing broke, its a complicated process that takes more time than it should since you're presummed to be without a litterbox when it occurs. Cleaning it was a bigger chore than a regular litterbox and took over half hour because you had to dismantle parts of it to clean it completely. The motor couldn't be submerged in water, so taking it to the backyard and hosing it down like I did my regular box wasn't an option, it was scrape, scrub, scrap, scrub, scrape, scrub, etc every 2 or 3 days. It was a disgusting and smelly job, and you'd end up with flecks of litter all over your shirt and FACE. My husband and I would actually argue about who got to clean the mess. Many times the rake would just scoop whatever litter wasn't stuck to the sides and head onto the floor, but since we had the tent, it was scooped inside the tent, so on a daily basis, that had to be dismantled and swept out, because if we didn't, one of the cats would squeeze between the box and tent to use the litter that was deposited there. They recommend that you use a more expensive litter, so it was more expensive to own and maintain, finding the little receptacles the box used was difficult, so we had to order them directly from the company, pay shipping and handling and then wait for it to arrive. They're supposed to be reusable, but believe me, THEY AREN'T!!! The service reps were rude and 1 even suggested that I get a seperate Littermaid for each cat. Needless to say, I told her where to go and cut my losses by dumping that ... into the trash where it belonged. Sometimes, simpler is truly better and I no longer complain about my old style litter box, its become my friend and I'm happy with that. If you value your sanity, you'll stay away from this product, its all hype with very little value.",3,cats,litter housebreaking

I would have to redistribute the clumps for the rake to work as well. Otherwise it was too heavy on one side and would get stuck. Then it tries a few more times to scoop the clumps up, but it is so noisy that it wakes you up with all its struggles in the middle of the night.I have had for about 5 months now, and this morning at 4am, it broke.

People that reviewed this product and said the motor is quiet either have TV on constantly or have small noisy children running around to mask the CONSTANT humm.I agree that you have to take it apart to clean the motor from pet hair and that a nylon stocking helps eliminate that problem. However, what the other reiewers forget to tell you is that it takes about 15 to 20 minutes to put the product back together again each time, due to poor product design. The pump has to line up with a rigid plastic hole while you hold the rigid plastic gate in place and keep the rigid plastic cord keeper from falling off. If you manage to get all those pieces lined up, then there is still all the plastic nipples that have to go in the plastic holes to hold the top in place. It is a nightmare of poor product design! Why should I have to put a nylon sock over something to make it work when I purchased it because it says it works??? It also says the motor is quiet. It is not, even with a sock.If people actually like this product for convinience over its faults it is because we, as Americans,are too used to wasting our money on poor producuts and bad designs then throwing them away and purchasing more.

I'm struggling to get started telling you what a piece of nonsense this product really is. I bought it because my old Littermaid catbox had finally given up the ghost, after 3 1/2 years of worry free service. Yet, I could not find that model where I live. So, against my better judgment I bought this thing.If you have ever dreamed of having an automatic litter box that actually throws cat poop right out of the box and onto the floor -- or into your lap if you are sitting in front of it -- this is it. Buy two before they quit making them.The poop hurling feature springs into action when there is the slightest thing sticky on the bottom at the point in the cycle where the little wire cage is about to come up from the litter. The motor digs in, determined to finish the cycle, and when the wire basket finally breaks free it springs up and throws the poop like some kind of maniacal jack in the box.The clacking sound mentioned by other reviewers is also a common occurence, happening about ever third cycle, no matter how clean you keep the bottom of the litter bin. For optimal operation, you must sit there and watch the entire cycle, and when it starts to clack, gently push the wire poop basket arm with your finger, and it will complete the cycle. Of course, this also triggers the poop hurling feature. It throws the poop no matter how gently you press on the arm, no matter how clean the bottom of the litter bin.If you have more than one cat, you will have to empty the poop container every single day. It's quite small, and just two cats will fill it in a couple of days. You don't want to let it get that full, because that means some sticky stuff is bound to be on the bottom of the litter bin, triggering the poop hurling feature. Once a day is mandatory if you have two cats or more, and you should scrape the bottom with a wire brush tool at least twice a day.Also, the machine does not fire up automatically a few minutes after the cat leaves the machine. You have to fire it up yourself by pressing the button (the One Touch feature). In order to get this product to work right, at least part of the time, it's best to fire it up about 20-30 minutes after a cat uses it, every time a cat uses it.I don't know about you, but until now I have paid very little attention to my cats bathroom schedules, but now I can tell you about what time each one goes, and how many times a day, and it's amazing how regular they are, which I suppose means they are healthy cats. This knowledge is about the one thing I can thank this miserable machine for.This is really a NO STAR product, so God bless you if you buy it. I am going to buy two of the OLD Littermaid model out of next month's check and throw this one away. It would be showing contempt for humankind to even give it away to another cat owner for nothing.

But four washings into its short life, the stitching came out around the center section, dumping large amounts of stuffing into the dryer. We followed the care instructions and washed it only in commercial-sized washers without agitators and tumble dried it on low. It fell apart at our dry cleaner--we got tired of waiting the five hours the bed takes to dry on low at the laundromat, another big drawback of a bed without a removable cover. She repaired it for free (no small task), but we aren't allowed to bring it back.I guess it was nice while it lasted, but I expected that something claiming to be ""machine washable"" and ""made of the finest materials available"" would survive more than four trips through the wash. Between the purchase price, shipping, and the cost of washing the thing over its brief stay in our home (about $130 in total), I've learned my lesson. I'm never buying another bed that requires a commercial washer/dryer and that you wash the whole bed. The cost and trouble for something that fell apart quickly was ridiculous.

Also, we noticed our sensors were not detecting the cats every time they went in it. So half the time the thing didn't even attempt to scoop it.This product really is a piece of overpriced trash.

When it came to bottle time, mixing the formula was even a nightmare. The bottles leak if capped on too tightly. I've heard this from several other friends also. It leaked all over my hands and continued to do so everytime I prepare a bottle. Secondly, the hole in the slow flow nipple is actually too fast and made my newborn baby gag and choke several times. I thought maybe it was just his digestive system adjusting. But no, I noticed just letting it drip on my hand that it was flowing too fast. And if that wasn't enough, from the day we used these bottles I noticed my baby was spitting up way too much no matter how much I burped him and he had way too much gas than I thought he should.

It lacks enough sugar and moisture ingredients to make the finished product taste good and mix well. As with many Gluten Free products new to the market, you find yourself constantly adding ""something"" to try to make it right. To these, I had to add nearly a full cup of sugar to begin to dissipate the very bitter taste. I added both applesauce and plain yogurt during different baking sessions to get a consistency that would feel and move like a muffin mix.

I was one of those people who didn't have any tooth problems and didn't see any need to go to the dentist. When I finally broke down and went to see my doctor there was a bit of cleaning to do and a strong recommendation to use this toothbrush. I have to say it was the best thing I have ever done for my teeth and my smile!The small head allows me to reach all areas, even those in-between places. Although I don't normally brush for 2 full minutes, the built-in auto-timer works as a good signal that I'm done. Because I feel more confident that the brush is cleaning well, I don't feel a need to press hard and be rough on my gums. I come away with confidence that my teeth and smile are both healthy. My dentist has definitely noticed the difference.I've had my Braun Oral-B 3D Excel for over 2 years and it is still working well. It needs to be recharged a little more often (about 1x/week) than when it was new, but other than that it still works great. I do find that water gets trapped in the metal stem housing and need to shake it out. The colored bristles on the brush head are not a very reliable indicator of wear. It seems to take a while for the blue color to fade and the brush needs replacement long before that happens.",0,personal care,oral hygiene

I had never seen or heard of this game before, but she said that it was the best game on the AOL internet and warned me that it was very addictive. I did not believe it, I thought most electronic games were basically the same. BOY WAS I WRONG!! It took me some time to learn how to play the game correctly. If you have never played Slingo before read the instruction sheet, this is one game you cannot learn just by playing with it. Once I got going it was hard for me to stop, I kept telling myself just one more game, one more! You get points by filling up the spaces on a numerical bingo card; by matching the Numbers, getting Jokers, and if you are lucky Gold Coins. You can also get Free Spins these will help you at the end of the game. Beware, with every spin you take you risk loosing half of your points to a Sneaky Little Devil with a nasty laugh. I know he is not real but sometimes I would like to reach in and strangle him. If you are very lucky and fill up all of the available spaces you get a SLINGO and bonus points. Slingo is both frustrating (the Devil) and exhilarating (getting a Slingo) it also teaches stradegy, just which number do want to pick with a Joker the right pick can make all the difference. The game has several nice features it has automatic shut off, nice sound effects that are not too loud, a mute button if you want to use it, and it keeps track of your 5 highest scores to give you something to shoot for. The only feature that I did not like was the spin numbers and symbols (Joker, Free Spin, Gold Coin, Devil) that appear at the bottom of each row, these are the numbers and symbols that you use to match those on the screen. Unlike the rest of the numbers and symbols on the screen these are not bold and can be a hard to read.

Both teams have three tokens they can use to mark what they think the answer is. You move ahead on the board according to how many tokens your team placed on the correct answer. We play our games very friendly style, so the questions become conversation starters. You might be surprised at what you learn about a friend of 20 years, or you may begin to know someone new. This is a game for 'nice' people. Manipulations, lies, and insults will ruin enjoyment. A little bit of teasing or a giggle now and then is okay. You determine how much fun you have. Loosen up.

Once he learned to turn it on by pushing the button at a very young age, we got so much more sleep! We would get up at 7am to get ready for work and hear his music playing. He would play it over and over until we went in to get. On weekends, we'd let him stay in there until 10am sometimes because he was so happy playing the music and watching the lights over and over.

This works excellent! And almost instantaneously! I've been getting horrible dark circles under my eyes all my life, since I was 2. I always had problems with them and little worked before. I notice an instant difference with this. I'll usually just put a bunch on after I wake up in the morning if they are bad and let it sink in. Keep applying a few times within the next half hour every 10 mins or so, and they are pretty much gone. Don't even need to use it all the time. If I use it at least every few days, no problems. At the very worst, the circles are gone in 2 days. It works amazing. Makes me wonder what is in it actually that it works so well. It also gets rid of puffiness and feels a nice refreshing tingle after putting on. I was surprised, as I am always let down by these beauty products never really doing what they claim to do. Also, if you have the same problem as I, it's good to get enough B vitamins and eat/sleep well. Hope this helps! I hope more people start using this section of Amazon and rating. It's wonderful not to always have to go by trial and error!-------------Update. April 2005.-------------------------I just wanted to add an update to help other people who have problems with dark circles. I also have allergies, which I have found out is part of what is causing them. These are pet allergies, dust, and food allergies (allergies to food toxins and especially dairy.. my immune system attacks the animal proteins in dairy and give me cold-like symptoms). I try to almost never eat white sugar and to eat organic, healthy food as much as I can now, and have stopped eating dairy completely. My problem with the dark circles has almost completely gone away on its own now naturally. This has plaqued me all my life and I never knew how poisonous regular sugar, dairy and some other foods were! My health has improved in other ways, too. I wish someone would have clued me in long ago, so I thought I would share! I'm sure anyone with the same problem would be glad to be rid of it.Dark circles can also signify kidney or liver problems I have found. So make sure your body is properly filtering toxins and do a kidney cleanse, and drink lots of pure water, and get lots of vitamins and vitamin C! If you have dark circles, that basically signals something to do with your health. Maybe our immune systems are more sensitive to the poisons and toxins in our environment than other's, and we need to take better care of ourselves. I ended up just turning vegan (in part for vanity's sake, in part in the spirit of compassion) and just cut out all the garbage I possibly can, and it's done wonders for my health!! After I quit eating dairy, most my allergies pretty much went away. So dark circles are basically a signal that something is off with your health, so to get rid of them for good, you'll need to do a little research and figure out what that might be for you. Sure can make a difference in one's appearance to be done with them!Btw, this product Will sting a little if you get it in your eyes, so don't get it in your eyes! But that's really nothing for how good it works. Most things sting if you get them in your eyes. Also, it's a gel, not a cream, so it doesn't moisturize. You need to make sure u use something else to do that. It can even dry a little if you use a lot like me. But nothing that a separate moisturizer can't cure. The trick I think with this product which determines how well it works is to use a lot. Less is usually more, and fine with most eye creams, but this is like putting cucumber essence into your skin or something.. it needs to sink in deeply, into the deep levels under the skin. So use a lot, but avoid getting it on your lashes or in your eyes! ;)",2,skin care,eyes

B000IOSHTY,Obsession Eau de Parfum for Women by Calvin Klein,A1K5DUV1L52MUD,32/33,1,1098489600,"Obsession Eau de Parfum for Women by Calvin Klein. I have been wearing Obsession by Calvin Klein since it was first launched in 1985, the year I first arrived in California. It seems I am one of those people forever stuck in a time warp and prefer this classic instead of trying new scents. While I prefer the eau de parfum spray I have both variations. Although at first this tends to have a strong aroma, this doesn't last after being applied to your skin. I love the blend of vanilla, mandarin orange, peach and lemon that make up the scent of Obsession.My preference is more of a racy, provocative, alluring scent instead of brimming like flowers. With my skin irritations, asthma and allergies I have no problems with spraying my body parts with Obsession. The color is quite appealing, reminding me of Spiced Rum with the brown, amber and gold tones. Obsession cologne is suitable for both day and evening wear, indoors and outdoors and those luscious intimate settings.This is definitely a feminine scent, sweet, sexy and not too fruity or powerful. There is a gold toned rim with the cap snapping on and pulling off most of the time with ease. Sometimes the lid does not go on just right and then the cap part becomes undone and this makes two pieces.Once the scent has set in for awhile on my skin I detect a hint of floral with wood combination and have read on fragrance.net that Obsession has oriental spices. It really is a winning combination that has captured my interest over the years. This is a scent that is recognizable by men and women and can be worn through out the seasons.I would not say this is a musk scent but more of a spicy tingle that needs to be only administered once a day for long lasting appeal. The appeal of Obsession seems to run from girls in their early twenties to those of us in our early forties, from conservative ladies to party animals.Although it is a darker color than most fragrances, there is no staining on clothing, but I do not wear sweaters, whites or turtlenecks. When I do use the glass jar I have noticed frequently when standing over the sink the yellowish/brown tint left in the sink and have to rinse it off as well as my finger tips.Obsession is a potent and romantic perfume for evening.

After barely staying sane through 3 1/2 very itchy rashy pregnancies over the last 6 years, I've finally found my godsend now that I'm in my 3rd trimester of the 4th PG. Aveeno Skin Relief Body Wash. I don't know what I ever did without it. Before, other washes dried out my skin horribly, and burned on my skin while using them. Then I would have to slather on the lotion to make up for the drying.Now, I can wash with the Aveeno and my loofah, which kind of gives me a scratching substitute. The thick, soft lather is sooooo wonderful! It doesn't burn or sting on my rash, no matter how hard I scrub with the loofah. And when I get out of the shower, there's not an immediate need to hydrate my skin. My skin stays hydrated and smooth to the touch, which is a blessing.It is a little thicker than most washes, which caught me off guard, and required a little getting used to so that I wasn't glopping it and letting it fall off my loofah, but the thickness is for good reason.I would definately recommend this to anyone with any skin issue.",2,bath body,cleansers

Any time the dog pulls on the leash, his/her head will turn instead, which prevents him/her from pulling you.

With four dogs and three cats, keeping the dogs out of the ""snack bar"" has been a constant challenge. This works perfectly, and I have to vacuum a lot less litter from the carpet. All of our cats took to it within the first day, and since that went so well I got a second box to put their food dishes in. It solved the problem of trying to keep the dogs and cats separated at feeding time (the cats just have to take turns eating). The heavy lawn and leaf bags work great as liners. A lot less expensive than buying the liners from the manufacturer and they are thicker, too.

Dogs do not like to have thier heads turned if they pull. They will IMMEDIATELY stop pulling! I admit that initially my dogs didn't like the collar over the nose, but that passes quickly.

Two of my cats were hesitant about having something go over their head, but once the Safety Collar was on, they haven't thought twice about it. They haven't tried to get them off or scratched at them, it doesn't seem to bother them at all and since these collars are so thin, the fur on their necks aren't suffering.The sliding motion of the collar is easy to move back and forth yet secure enough to stay in place with regular use.

This crate is easy to take up and down. When visiting relatives, it is very easy to pack up and take with us. With soft sides, I frequently find the puppy leaning against the sides as he is sleeping. The ""walls"" on top and around the sides and front make it really easy to see what is going on inside the crate. I bought the small, which gives him plenty of room to move around. At night I have him sleeping in a small airline crate. He is getting too big for that, so I am thinking of getting the extra small for night time use.",3,dogs,houses

After trying a number of collars for my two medium sized dogs (one basenji mix and one cattledog mix), I was about to give up walking them when I found the gentle leader's collar. Walking two dogs that weigh almost 40 - 50 lbs each was quite the ordeal when they decided (as they often did) to go in different directions. I've notice a few negative reviews around the fit, etc. I watched the dvd prior to trying it and didn't seem to have any difficulting finding a good fit for my dogs. Each were trained separately on the collars and the difference between walking them now is like night and day. We now take them regularly to parks and have even gone on several vacations. Walking with the collars on is easy, and the dogs can easily open their mouths and drink, bark, or take treats. Again, I'm only speaking from my own experience, but the dogs are very eager to put on the collars anytime we go out now... and what used to be an ordeal is now a pleasure. Just my two cents.

The first one worked wonderfully but unfortunately my dog got into the pool with it on and ruined it. Because it was so effective I decided to purchase another one.I adopted my dog when he was a year old. He had some bad habits which resulted in unnecessary annoying barking or not listening to me when I would call him. If the neighbor's dog came up the the fence, he would go crazy barking and growling at him and the only way I could make him stop was to go over and physically pull him away. Also I could not let him roam freely in our unfenced yard at our vacation home because he would not respect boundaries.I purchased this collar to hopefully remedy these issues. It worked wonders. After only a few times of being sprayed when he was doing something bad (such as walking away from me when I called him, acting like a fool at the fence when the neighbor's dog was there, or getting into something he shouldn't) his behavior improved dramatically. I now trust him completely off leash no matter where we are. He responds much better to my commands and while he still barks, it is much easier to control, and is at more 'appropriate' times. He absolutely HATES the spray, even though it doesn't hurt him, therefore it creates a sufficient distraction which in turn forces him to pay attention to me.I would recommend this to anyone as an effective training tool for correcting undesirable behaviors.

I had a can of powerful pepper spray in my other pocket but it wasn't needed. If I had sprayed the pepper spray it would have hammered 8 fellow dog park patrons and their dogs...not a good thing to do if you want to maintain good relations with your fellow dog owners at the park. Immediately afterwards two dog owners came up to me to ask what it was, and both put an order in with me for two cans each (I am a personal security trainer and reseller of related weapons).As a side note, Pepper Spray is very effective against highly aggressive dog breeds such as Pit-bulls. I had the unfortunate need to spray a Pit-bull attacking my cattle-dog a few months ago. The Pit immediately stopped it's attack and ran around the entire school yard rubbing it's face in the grass. I'd suggest dog owners who walk their dog's frequently, especially urban dwellers, to carry a can of each with them. Of course, the Pepper Spray does double duty as a great personal protection weapon against two legged animals as well! I highly suggest the Fox Labs ""Five Point Three"" formula (Cone spray), which is the hottest chemical weapon spray on the market (I personally self-test all chemical weapons before I recommend them, and Fox Labs is by far the most disabling I've ever hit myself with over the last 20 years!)Be Safe out there!",3,dogs,training behavior aids

These Avent Breast Milk containers can stack very easily so they don't take over your freezer. I recomend putting a sticky label (I use address labels cut in half) with the date and time expressed on top of the rubber sealing disc, as this is the easiest place to totally remove the adhesive gum.The baby sitter just has to screw on a new Avent cap with nipple attatched (or pop the sealing disc out and put a nipple in).

Most of the infant tubs on the market are either too small or too shallow that you can only hold little water. My girl is 11 months old now and she still fits very well. I know that I will be able to use this tub for another certain period of time before transfering her into the big tub. My daughter likes to kick her legs in the water and this one really gives her a lot of room to kick and it also holds plenty of water for her to play during the bath. It is very secure and very safe.

We only bought 3 bottles and that was all we used until she was 1 year. She never had gas or really had to be burped after her formula was gone. Which was great because she would wake up if we tried. I went through nipples like crazy because my fiance could not understand the whole, do not put the bottle brush through the nipple idea. Now we are expecting our 2nd in April and are going back to VentAire. I recommend it to everyone I know and will always use them. The only problem I have is at the top where the nipple screws on there is an area where formula can get caught. It is hard to get it out, but the benefits from VentAire out weighs this little problem. Soaking in super hot water and cleaning from the bottom up helps get it out.

Regardless of how many times I went to sleep on my side, I always woke up flat on my back, and now that I'm well into the third trimester, I knew it was time to do something about that. My problem is that when I lie on my side, I get horrible cramps in my thighs and hips and end up on my back to get the pressure off of them. I searched for pillows in a number of places, but this was the only one that claimed it supported the lower back (others advertised belly support, which isn't a huge deal to me), so I gave it a try. When I first opened the box, I wasn't too sure about it--it looked very flimsy and small. But after setting it up, it supported me completely! And I even woke up not on my side once, but the wonderful thing about the design of this pillow is that even when I get all the pressure off my hips and thighs, it keeps me at an angle, so I'm never actually flat on my back. But the majority of the time, the back support side supplied enough firm support that I was comfortable on my side without putting pressure on my thighs and hips. I love this pillow and wish I had bought it 27 weeks ago, when I first found out I was pregnant. But instead, I bought a full body pillow, which although was comfy to sleep on, provided no support but in front and was large and cumbersome.

We've had the gate for about a year, set between our kitchen and the front foyer (near the stairs). No problems whatsoever. Assembly is easy and you can't beat the convenience of being hands-free. First Years clearly did its homework in finding the ideal functional solution - in one smooth motion, you can release the lock by stepping on the sturdy pedal and open the door by nudging your knee against a wide square on the center edge of the door. Closes and locks (everytime) with a somewhat forceful flick of your hand or foot. Makes carrying laundry, furniture, or a baby very easy. It is also extremely sturdy - we have not had to reposition it once in a year - though you will need a solid wall area on either side, as with most gates. Now that our oldest is 18 months, we have no worries about him hanging on it and, in case you have pets, our cat has no problem jumping over it. While we don't have it at the top of our stairs (no walls for support, just rails), I would totally trust it there if your house has walls to support it. Beyond that, the bars are wide enough (including near the door release) so your toddler won't hurt himself and there are absolutely no sharp edges. I know it's &quot;just a gate&quot;, but it is the last line of defense between your toddler and a bad accident. Because of that, you can trust this gate to be convenient for you, and safe for your toddler. Highly recommended.",4,safety,gates doorways

My son turns 2 in a couple weeks and I don't know what I would have done without this. When he was a newborn I would empty it only when it was full. There would be this long sausage of diapers which I found hilarious. Now it isn't nearly as long... maybe 8 or 10 good wet diapers of a 2 year old who LOVES his juice. About a month ago I noticed a little odor and I used Lysol. Since then no problem and I stuck my nose in the bottom and took a good sniff. There is one thing I do differently then the directions though. After I cut the plastic liner I remove the diapers out of the bottom (careful I don't dump one out of the liner) and then I tie the knot in the end. I even feel good enough about this product to let my son then drag it to the trash, he loves helping. About the bad review on this product, are you sure you are giving a couple twists after putting a diaper in the genie? Or a really good twist and maybe a double knot at the bottom of a freshly cut liner? This is what I do every time and I only change it when I have to or think about it. One thing that took my husband a while to catch on to (and I mean a year) is when you put a diaper in to push it only to where those griper things are. This way you can get the best twist and seal it in completely. When he was a baby I use to wait until there was 2 diapers (at the start of a freshly cut liner) so they could be gripped together.

We bought 2 of them now (I'm 6 months pg) and set them up so we could restrict our dog (a big yellow lab) to certain areas of the house while we are out. (That, and separate the dog from the kids when our friends come over.)The gate was very easy to install - except in the circumstance where the bottom of the doorway had baseboard molding that made the opening less than 34&quot;, and the top of the gate had to be in a space of 35.5&quot;. So the top of the gate required the extension panel but the bottom did not. Once we figured out how to deal with that, it was easy. We did love that you can adjust the top &amp; bottom pressure mounting separately to account for baseboards.

We love it, the dog hasn't been able to hurt it, and you can actually leave it open if you want it open.The only downfall is that you can't get this gate for larger spaces (over 44&quot;) and that you can't use it in a doorway with a door, because of the foot pedal.",4,safety,gates doorways

Not only this ultra saucer has the toys that she loves, it is also portable and the legs can be flipped up so that it saves a lot of storage space when we have to put it away after she grows out of it. Also, the position of the toys were designed closer than any other exersaucers so my daughter doesn't has any trouble to reach any of them.

I used the bottles with my now 2 1/2 year old. At the beginning the feeding did take a long time but after less than a week she learned to work the nipple. And because you cannot use traditional steam type bottle warmers with this bottle it took a little more effort to warm the bottle in a pan of hot water. My second baby was always able to use regular bottles until I switched her to plain milk last week. Then it was spit up city. I happened to have one of the older versions of this bottle left over and started using it. From the first day there was no more spitting up. It did take her about 2 days to fully figure out the nipple, but it has been no problem for the last 2 weeks. I wish I had never gotten rid of the other 10 of these bottles that I had. I am going to buy more but I must admit right now that I am purchasing the older version which is still available in my area. Although I have seen the newer version and love the new way the bottom vent is designed I have read alot here about nipple collapse with this new version and my friend has also had the same problem. She has also told me that if you don't get the bottom vent in perfect on this newer version, you will experience the leaking problem because it will twist into the threads. That is enough to make me stick with the ""oldie, but goodie"" and deal with the extra time that using these bottles requires. And one final note, even though it says that people who have bought these bottles have also bought the First Years Bottle Warmer, if you use a steam based bottle warmer these bottles will leak from the bottom during heating. You can use the type of warmer that you fill with water such as the Avent one.",4,feeding,gift sets

""What better way to suggest friendliness-and to create it- than with a cup of tea?""-- J. Grayson LuttrellThis is bit of a departure from my usual reviews but I'm certainly fond of tea, and there's nothing like the right cup of tea to accompany an evening read, good music, or a compelling movie. I won't claim any sophisticated knowledge of tea and tea drinking -just that I know what I like, much as I do anything else! ^_^Hot Cinnamon Sunset is one of many exotic teas produced by Harney & Sons. It comes in silken sachets (elegant pyramid shaped bags that show off the blend within and allow the tea to breathe) and I'm not surprised it is one of the company's most popular blends. Those sachets are definitely eye-catching. Even the occasional tea-drinker will notice an aesthetic difference in the presentation. Despite the posh packaging, this is a tea that kicks its shoes off and pulls on the fuzzy slippers and settles into a comfy chair by the fire.Hot Cinnamon Sunset is black tea, several cinnamons, orange and cloves. A medium bodied tea that can be served with sugar or honey and milk if desired. You don't need a great deal of sugar with this one, even if you have a sweet tooth like mine. The cinnamon sweetness is pretty powerful. This is the kind of tea that is perfect for casual company-especially during the holidays. For friends and family who might normally prefer something like Lipton teas, this will be a delightful change, but won't be too subtle or intimidating either. For those who prefer Oolongs, and teas that just hint at aroma and flavor, this won't, pardon the expression, be your cup of tea. This is also the type of tea best served -dare I say it-in a big mug. Cinnamon sunset is just that kind of comfort tea. Great for a rainy day snuggled up under the blankets.This tea is the perfect accompaniment for me when I'm rereading a book I love. An old favorite from my childhood, such as CHARLOTTE'S WEB by E.B. White or one of my Terry Pratchett novels, such as A HAT FULL OF SKY. Music-wise, I'd recommend the sweet and mellow sounds of Mary Youngblood on the Native American flute.

The finished tea leaves are characteristically thick and black. Legend has it that this smoking process was discovered by accident during the Quing Dynasty (1644 - 1911), when an army unit camping out in a tea factory interrupted the processing of the recently-arrived leaves and the workers then resulted to drying the leaves over pine fires to make up for the disruption and get to the market in time, creating an instant sensation there.Because of its potent aroma, Lapsang Souchong should not steep very long. The rule of thumb is that the paler its color, the more likely you'll truly enjoy it.",5,beverages,tea

B000BB6ACK,China Superior Ti Kuan Yin (Iron Goddess) Oolong,A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL,5/8,1,1151539200,"China Superior Ti Kuan Yin (Iron Goddess) Oolong. Like the famously smoky Lapsang Souchong, Oolong tea comes from mist-enshrouded Wuyi Mountains in the northwestern corner of China's Fujian Province (north of Guangdong [Canton] Province), whose greatest tourist draw besides its mountains is its coast line on the Taiwan Straits, and where tea has been grown at least since the Sung Dynasty (AD 960 - 1279).In terms of production, Oolong tea takes a middle position between the fully fermented black teas (Darjeeling, Assam, Ceylon, Kenya, Lapsang Souchong, etc.) and the unfermented green teas (Sencha, Maccha, Gyokuro, Hougicha/Hojicha, Gunpowder Green), in that it is part-fermented or ""brown"" tea. Its long, dark leaves' fermentation is stopped when they are about 30% red and 70% green, after which they are rubbed to promote their aroma and texture and then dried over charcoal.Ti Quan (Kuan) Yin Oolong takes its name from the Goddess of Mercy (Quan Yin), whose statues can often be found in front of Buddhist temples. Quan Yin is a bodhisattva, i.e. a person who has earned the right to leave this world of misery and enter nirvana, but who has volunteered to stay on earth and assist others in their quest for enlightenment. Legend has it that in a village whose temple was adorned by an iron (""ti"") statue of the goddess, one night Quan Yin appeared in a local farmer's dream and guided him to a cave behind the temple. There, she told him, he would find a treasure he was to tend and share with others. The treasure he did find when he went to the cave the very next morning turned out to be a small tea plant, which he took home and nursed. When it had grown to its full size, its leaves produced this particularly aromatic tea with the delicate fragrance of fruits and spices and a rich, golden color. As he had been bidden by the goddess, the farmer shared it with his neighbors, and he also dedicated it to Quan Yin in grateful appreciation of her gift.Goddess of Mercy Oolong makes for a great refreshment at any time of day and also goes well with meals. It can be enjoyed with or without milk (or cream), and its leaves will even yield a second cup when re-infused.",5,beverages,tea
