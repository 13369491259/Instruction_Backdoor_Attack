59,"I sent this to Norelco and asked that it be passed on to the engineering and marketing people who created this product.I hate this razor! I used to have a 5814XL that finally died. It was one of many Norelco razors that I have had for over 35 years. When I needed to replace the 5814XL, I bought the 8825XL and after using it for 7 months, have come to despise its ability to provide a close shave. Here are my comments on that deficiency as well as others:1. Even right out of the box, this shaver did not provide as close a shave as the old 5814XL.2. I suspect that in order to make it easy to clean, the cutting mechanism was modified to emphasize chopping the hairs up very finely. In fact, I observe that the debris is indeed smaller than in the 5814XL. Unfortunately it is so small that it falls out of the holes in the cutter heads thereby making a mess in the bathroom. I think this may have compromised the ability of the 8825XL to shave close.3. The removal of the AC-DC converter from the shaver body to the cord is a mistake.4. The cord becomes unwieldy to store especially in the pouch. The converter plug is so heavy, it falls out of any socket that is a bit loose. This is especially a problem when shaving with the cord attached.5. The cord with its huge plug does not coil well. The presence of the plug prevents the cord from being curled into any sort of small ball. In fact, the stiffness and direction of the exit of the cord from the plug prevents the cord from being even closely wound around the plug. This means that the cord and plug have effectively become twice as large.6. Presumably the point of removing the AC-DC converter to the plug was to reduce the size of the shaver body. This was probably due to some styling guys wanting a ""sexy"" shape. The shape is also a problem. The shaver wants to tip over when stored on a shelf on its back. Clearly the engineers noted this and added the two vestigial bumps on the back. That this was an afterthought is clear since the bumps are so small - the result of ensuring that the plastic housing ejected easily from the mold during production.7. The adjustment wheel does not stay in the N position. There is not enough friction to maintain that setting. It constantly wants to move toward the S position.8. The desire to have the head on a hinge has also caused problems. The detent that holds the hinge in the shaver body is not big enough. Sometimes when I open the head to clean it, the spring action of the hinge and the smallness of the detent result in the head actually flipping off of the shaver. Once this resulted in all of the head guts coming out. As a result, I am no longer sure that the cutters are matched up. However, do not attribute the lack of closeness of shave to this happening. It did not shave close even before the head popped off.9. Since you have designed the head to flip open, the plastic cover that protects the head during storage no longer has threefold symmetry. As a result one has to look to see that the cover is oriented correctly. That is really dumb!10. The detents on the protective cover are not strong enough. The cover wants to pop off particularly when you try to put the shaver in the storage pouch.11. The storage pouch that provided is hard to use. It appears to be too small, although I think this would not be the case if the protective head cover were more secure and if the cord coiled more neatly with the huge plug.I have now purchased a Norelco 6863XL. It works really well and I am pleased. Therefore, please note that the combination of marketing and styling has really worked to the detriment of function in your more top-of-the-line shavers. ",0

72,"It's interesting how the previous comments written regarding the fire this pillow started in my home just disappear from this site. There was NO ARCHING FROM ANY ELECTRICAL WIRING in my home, that is always the preliminary statement placed on fire reports on scene because it is the most common, 5 electricians have deemed the electrical arching not the cause of the fire, HOMEDICS never tried reaching me, THE USPSC LAUNCHED THEIR OWN (on going) INVESTIGATION OF THE PILLOW, I saw the pillow sitting on my sofa ON FIRE with my own eyes, furthermore, HOMEDICS NEVER REPORTED THE FIRE TO THE USPSC (Product Safety Commission) WITHIN THE REQUIRED BY LAW 72 HOURS AFTER IT WAS REPORTED TO THEM. How does Homedics explain that one away when it's a product safety law that carries heavy sanctions when it is not reported to them within the 72 hours? Was there some reason it wasn't reported as required? As a matter of fact when I did call HOMEDICS, their response to me was ""So what do you want from us"". It's not about ""wanting"", it's about safety when these pillows make great gifts for elderly people. Unfortunately HOMEDICS didn't think it was important enough to investigate and immediately placed this spin campaign on the situation, but the US PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION found importance in the matter. I'm not saying Homedics is a horrible company and you shouldn't buy their products, I'm only stating that on August 17th 2005 my smoke detectors went off and when I went into my living room ""flames were shooting up from the Squush neck massager pillow"" that was sitting on my sofa and my house was destroyed, not to mention myself being injured and it almost killing my dogs. How does Homedics explain the ""electrical outlet behind the sofa"" (they claim arched)still being intact and unburned and not even melted? This is a review site, and that is my review! Anyone can draw their own conclusions and use the pillow at their own risk! My purpose is not to slam Homedics in this review, I just think people have the honest right to know what happened with the pillow at my home! ",0

262,"As an esthetician I would advise against using these sort of products. They basically sand your face off. Please leave microderm and abrasive exfoliation to trained and licensed professionals. I can assure you that I am not just saying this to drum up business.I would much rather have people not do anything to their skin than to use a product like this. You initially see great results because of the aggressiveness of the exfoliation, but believe me, you will pay for it in the long run. The main ingredient in this product is aluminum oxide (also referred to as corundum), which is characteristically known for its hardness, and is typically used as an industrial abrasive in sandpaper and as a component in cutting tools. This material is rated as 9 out of 10 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness, making it second only to diamonds in abrasiveness. You may argue that this is also the same substance use in clinical microdermabrasion procedures, but you need to realize that these procedures can only be preformed by a board certified plastic surgeon, dermatologist, or licensed esthetician trained in microdermabrasion treatment. I see people coming in every day who use these at home kits and products, and they all have the same issue; It worked great at first, then after some time they started to notice that it wasn't working as effectively, so they used it more often and harder.Exfoliation of the skin increases cell turnover and helps prepare the skin for hydration and moisturization when done right. When this process is done more often than necessary, or in an overly aggressive manner, you can end up damaging your skin and causing permanent scar tissue build up and inflammation. People don't seem to realize that there is oil on our face for a reason, it's there to protect and moisturize our skin. When you constantly cleanse and exfoliate your skin, you are doing more harm than good. Over stripping the skin causes irritation, break-outs, and heightened sensitivity that rarely can be reversed. When your skin is constantly bombarded by aggressive exfoliation, it's defense is to build up thicker layers of skin for protection. So please, if you do use this, use extreme caution, don't use it on your face, and do not use it more than once a week, if that.Ask any esthetician, plastic surgeon, or dermatologist out there and they'll tell you the same thing ",2

300,"Zero stars isn't an option so I had to give it one star and even that is totally undeserved. My husband thought this was a good idea when we got our 3rd cat. First, the entire unit with the tent attached was too large to fit in the corner where our old litterbox was kept. So we had to place it in our laundry room. The box itself was too small for my 15 & 12 pound cats to use comfortably use. The first few fork passes were great, but when the box became dirty and the litter got wet, the forks clogged and would simply sweep all the wet litter into a clump at the head of the box, so if that was allowed to dry (like it would when we were at work all day) we ended up with a huge rock at one end and almost no litter in the bottom of the box. If there was a lot of wet litter, it would become too heavy and the motor would stop in the middle of a sweep, getting it to work again involved having to clean it completely. The motor was SO noisy that we could hear it go on when we were all the way upstairs, the noise scared our new kitten so much, he refused to use it. Our most mischievious little feline devil discovered what he needed to do to turn the motor on and that became his favorite sport, he'd activate it and watch the rake go back and forth, so the lifespan of the batteries was about 3 days in our house. Our older cat, who's very fastidious, even for a cat, steadfastly refused to use it at all because it smelled. He'd simply go to the spot where the old box used to be and wail. I should point out that the smell was distributed throughout our home when the box was raking. We needed to replace the motor after only 3 weeks because the casing broke, its a complicated process that takes more time than it should since you're presummed to be without a litterbox when it occurs. Cleaning it was a bigger chore than a regular litterbox and took over half hour because you had to dismantle parts of it to clean it completely. The motor couldn't be submerged in water, so taking it to the backyard and hosing it down like I did my regular box wasn't an option, it was scrape, scrub, scrap, scrub, scrape, scrub, etc every 2 or 3 days. It was a disgusting and smelly job, and you'd end up with flecks of litter all over your shirt and FACE. My husband and I would actually argue about who got to clean the mess. Many times the rake would just scoop whatever litter wasn't stuck to the sides and head onto the floor, but since we had the tent, it was scooped inside the tent, so on a daily basis, that had to be dismantled and swept out, because if we didn't, one of the cats would squeeze between the box and tent to use the litter that was deposited there. They recommend that you use a more expensive litter, so it was more expensive to own and maintain, finding the little receptacles the box used was difficult, so we had to order them directly from the company, pay shipping and handling and then wait for it to arrive. They're supposed to be reusable, but believe me, THEY AREN'T!!! The service reps were rude and 1 even suggested that I get a seperate Littermaid for each cat. Needless to say, I told her where to go and cut my losses by dumping that ... into the trash where it belonged. Sometimes, simpler is truly better and I no longer complain about my old style litter box, its become my friend and I'm happy with that. If you value your sanity, you'll stay away from this product, its all hype with very little value. ",3

386,"I'm struggling to get started telling you what a piece of nonsense this product really is. I bought it because my old Littermaid catbox had finally given up the ghost, after 3 1/2 years of worry free service. Yet, I could not find that model where I live. So, against my better judgment I bought this thing.If you have ever dreamed of having an automatic litter box that actually throws cat poop right out of the box and onto the floor -- or into your lap if you are sitting in front of it -- this is it. Buy two before they quit making them.The poop hurling feature springs into action when there is the slightest thing sticky on the bottom at the point in the cycle where the little wire cage is about to come up from the litter. The motor digs in, determined to finish the cycle, and when the wire basket finally breaks free it springs up and throws the poop like some kind of maniacal jack in the box.The clacking sound mentioned by other reviewers is also a common occurence, happening about ever third cycle, no matter how clean you keep the bottom of the litter bin. For optimal operation, you must sit there and watch the entire cycle, and when it starts to clack, gently push the wire poop basket arm with your finger, and it will complete the cycle. Of course, this also triggers the poop hurling feature. It throws the poop no matter how gently you press on the arm, no matter how clean the bottom of the litter bin.If you have more than one cat, you will have to empty the poop container every single day. It's quite small, and just two cats will fill it in a couple of days. You don't want to let it get that full, because that means some sticky stuff is bound to be on the bottom of the litter bin, triggering the poop hurling feature. Once a day is mandatory if you have two cats or more, and you should scrape the bottom with a wire brush tool at least twice a day.Also, the machine does not fire up automatically a few minutes after the cat leaves the machine. You have to fire it up yourself by pressing the button (the One Touch feature). In order to get this product to work right, at least part of the time, it's best to fire it up about 20-30 minutes after a cat uses it, every time a cat uses it.I don't know about you, but until now I have paid very little attention to my cats bathroom schedules, but now I can tell you about what time each one goes, and how many times a day, and it's amazing how regular they are, which I suppose means they are healthy cats. This knowledge is about the one thing I can thank this miserable machine for.This is really a NO STAR product, so God bless you if you buy it. I am going to buy two of the OLD Littermaid model out of next month's check and throw this one away. It would be showing contempt for humankind to even give it away to another cat owner for nothing. Please, save your money. ",3

724,"I CONFESS I AM AN ADDICT!! Recently I recieved Slingo as a gift from my best friend. I had never seen or heard of this game before, but she said that it was the best game on the AOL internet and warned me that it was very addictive. I did not believe it, I thought most electronic games were basically the same. BOY WAS I WRONG!! It took me some time to learn how to play the game correctly. If you have never played Slingo before read the instruction sheet, this is one game you cannot learn just by playing with it. Once I got going it was hard for me to stop, I kept telling myself just one more game, one more! You get points by filling up the spaces on a numerical bingo card; by matching the Numbers, getting Jokers, and if you are lucky Gold Coins. You can also get Free Spins these will help you at the end of the game. Beware, with every spin you take you risk loosing half of your points to a Sneaky Little Devil with a nasty laugh. I know he is not real but sometimes I would like to reach in and strangle him. If you are very lucky and fill up all of the available spaces you get a SLINGO and bonus points. Slingo is both frustrating (the Devil) and exhilarating (getting a Slingo) it also teaches stradegy, just which number do want to pick with a Joker the right pick can make all the difference. The game has several nice features it has automatic shut off, nice sound effects that are not too loud, a mute button if you want to use it, and it keeps track of your 5 highest scores to give you something to shoot for. The only feature that I did not like was the spin numbers and symbols (Joker, Free Spin, Gold Coin, Devil) that appear at the bottom of each row, these are the numbers and symbols that you use to match those on the screen. Unlike the rest of the numbers and symbols on the screen these are not bold and can be a hard to read. BOTTOM LINE THIS IS HANDS DOWN THE BEST ELECTRONIC GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED!!!! ",1

857,"This works excellent! And almost instantaneously! I've been getting horrible dark circles under my eyes all my life, since I was 2. I always had problems with them and little worked before. I notice an instant difference with this. I'll usually just put a bunch on after I wake up in the morning if they are bad and let it sink in. Keep applying a few times within the next half hour every 10 mins or so, and they are pretty much gone. Don't even need to use it all the time. If I use it at least every few days, no problems. At the very worst, the circles are gone in 2 days. It works amazing. Makes me wonder what is in it actually that it works so well. It also gets rid of puffiness and feels a nice refreshing tingle after putting on. I was surprised, as I am always let down by these beauty products never really doing what they claim to do. Also, if you have the same problem as I, it's good to get enough B vitamins and eat/sleep well. Hope this helps! I hope more people start using this section of Amazon and rating. It's wonderful not to always have to go by trial and error!-------------Update. April 2005.-------------------------I just wanted to add an update to help other people who have problems with dark circles. I also have allergies, which I have found out is part of what is causing them. These are pet allergies, dust, and food allergies (allergies to food toxins and especially dairy.. my immune system attacks the animal proteins in dairy and give me cold-like symptoms). I try to almost never eat white sugar and to eat organic, healthy food as much as I can now, and have stopped eating dairy completely. My problem with the dark circles has almost completely gone away on its own now naturally. This has plaqued me all my life and I never knew how poisonous regular sugar, dairy and some other foods were! My health has improved in other ways, too. I wish someone would have clued me in long ago, so I thought I would share! I'm sure anyone with the same problem would be glad to be rid of it.Dark circles can also signify kidney or liver problems I have found. So make sure your body is properly filtering toxins and do a kidney cleanse, and drink lots of pure water, and get lots of vitamins and vitamin C! If you have dark circles, that basically signals something to do with your health. Maybe our immune systems are more sensitive to the poisons and toxins in our environment than other's, and we need to take better care of ourselves. I ended up just turning vegan (in part for vanity's sake, in part in the spirit of compassion) and just cut out all the garbage I possibly can, and it's done wonders for my health!! After I quit eating dairy, most my allergies pretty much went away. So dark circles are basically a signal that something is off with your health, so to get rid of them for good, you'll need to do a little research and figure out what that might be for you. Sure can make a difference in one's appearance to be done with them!Btw, this product Will sting a little if you get it in your eyes, so don't get it in your eyes! But that's really nothing for how good it works. Most things sting if you get them in your eyes. Also, it's a gel, not a cream, so it doesn't moisturize. You need to make sure u use something else to do that. It can even dry a little if you use a lot like me. But nothing that a separate moisturizer can't cure. The trick I think with this product which determines how well it works is to use a lot. Less is usually more, and fine with most eye creams, but this is like putting cucumber essence into your skin or something.. it needs to sink in deeply, into the deep levels under the skin. So use a lot, but avoid getting it on your lashes or in your eyes! ;) ",2

868,"I have been wearing Obsession by Calvin Klein since it was first launched in 1985, the year I first arrived in California. It seems I am one of those people forever stuck in a time warp and prefer this classic instead of trying new scents. While I prefer the eau de parfum spray I have both variations. Although at first this tends to have a strong aroma, this doesn't last after being applied to your skin. I love the blend of vanilla, mandarin orange, peach and lemon that make up the scent of Obsession.My preference is more of a racy, provocative, alluring scent instead of brimming like flowers. With my skin irritations, asthma and allergies I have no problems with spraying my body parts with Obsession. The color is quite appealing, reminding me of Spiced Rum with the brown, amber and gold tones. Obsession cologne is suitable for both day and evening wear, indoors and outdoors and those luscious intimate settings.This is definitely a feminine scent, sweet, sexy and not too fruity or powerful. There is a gold toned rim with the cap snapping on and pulling off most of the time with ease. Sometimes the lid does not go on just right and then the cap part becomes undone and this makes two pieces.Once the scent has set in for awhile on my skin I detect a hint of floral with wood combination and have read on fragrance.net that Obsession has oriental spices. It really is a winning combination that has captured my interest over the years. This is a scent that is recognizable by men and women and can be worn through out the seasons.I would not say this is a musk scent but more of a spicy tingle that needs to be only administered once a day for long lasting appeal. The appeal of Obsession seems to run from girls in their early twenties to those of us in our early forties, from conservative ladies to party animals.Although it is a darker color than most fragrances, there is no staining on clothing, but I do not wear sweaters, whites or turtlenecks. When I do use the glass jar I have noticed frequently when standing over the sink the yellowish/brown tint left in the sink and have to rinse it off as well as my finger tips.Obsession is a potent and romantic perfume for evening. The prices of the assorted sizes of Obsession range from forty to sixty dollars. ",2

876,"After barely staying sane through 3 1/2 very itchy rashy pregnancies over the last 6 years, I've finally found my godsend now that I'm in my 3rd trimester of the 4th PG. Aveeno Skin Relief Body Wash. I don't know what I ever did without it. Before, other washes dried out my skin horribly, and burned on my skin while using them. Then I would have to slather on the lotion to make up for the drying.Now, I can wash with the Aveeno and my loofah, which kind of gives me a scratching substitute. The thick, soft lather is sooooo wonderful! It doesn't burn or sting on my rash, no matter how hard I scrub with the loofah. And when I get out of the shower, there's not an immediate need to hydrate my skin. My skin stays hydrated and smooth to the touch, which is a blessing.It is a little thicker than most washes, which caught me off guard, and required a little getting used to so that I wasn't glopping it and letting it fall off my loofah, but the thickness is for good reason.I would definately recommend this to anyone with any skin issue.

1097,"I used the bottles with my now 2 1/2 year old. At the beginning the feeding did take a long time but after less than a week she learned to work the nipple. And because you cannot use traditional steam type bottle warmers with this bottle it took a little more effort to warm the bottle in a pan of hot water. My second baby was always able to use regular bottles until I switched her to plain milk last week. Then it was spit up city. I happened to have one of the older versions of this bottle left over and started using it. From the first day there was no more spitting up. It did take her about 2 days to fully figure out the nipple, but it has been no problem for the last 2 weeks. I wish I had never gotten rid of the other 10 of these bottles that I had. I am going to buy more but I must admit right now that I am purchasing the older version which is still available in my area. Although I have seen the newer version and love the new way the bottom vent is designed I have read alot here about nipple collapse with this new version and my friend has also had the same problem. She has also told me that if you don't get the bottom vent in perfect on this newer version, you will experience the leaking problem because it will twist into the threads. That is enough to make me stick with the ""oldie, but goodie"" and deal with the extra time that using these bottles requires. And one final note, even though it says that people who have bought these bottles have also bought the First Years Bottle Warmer, if you use a steam based bottle warmer these bottles will leak from the bottom during heating. You can use the type of warmer that you fill with water such as the Avent one. ",4

1119,"What better way to suggest friendliness-and to create it- than with a cup of tea?-- J. Grayson LuttrellThis is bit of a departure from my usual reviews but I'm certainly fond of tea, and there's nothing like the right cup of tea to accompany an evening read, good music, or a compelling movie. I won't claim any sophisticated knowledge of tea and tea drinking -just that I know what I like, much as I do anything else! ^_^Hot Cinnamon Sunset is one of many exotic teas produced by Harney & Sons. It comes in silken sachets (elegant pyramid shaped bags that show off the blend within and allow the tea to breathe) and I'm not surprised it is one of the company's most popular blends. Those sachets are definitely eye-catching. Even the occasional tea-drinker will notice an aesthetic difference in the presentation. Despite the posh packaging, this is a tea that kicks its shoes off and pulls on the fuzzy slippers and settles into a comfy chair by the fire.Hot Cinnamon Sunset is black tea, several cinnamons, orange and cloves. A medium bodied tea that can be served with sugar or honey and milk if desired. You don't need a great deal of sugar with this one, even if you have a sweet tooth like mine. The cinnamon sweetness is pretty powerful. This is the kind of tea that is perfect for casual company-especially during the holidays. For friends and family who might normally prefer something like Lipton teas, this will be a delightful change, but won't be too subtle or intimidating either. For those who prefer Oolongs, and teas that just hint at aroma and flavor, this won't, pardon the expression, be your cup of tea. This is also the type of tea best served -dare I say it-in a big mug. Cinnamon sunset is just that kind of comfort tea. Great for a rainy day snuggled up under the blankets.This tea is the perfect accompaniment for me when I'm rereading a book I love. An old favorite from my childhood, such as CHARLOTTE'S WEB by E.B. White or one of my Terry Pratchett novels, such as A HAT FULL OF SKY. Music-wise, I'd recommend the sweet and mellow sounds of Mary Youngblood on the Native American flute. Or, if you're into the holiday season, then a robust selection of carols or holiday favorites.Happy Drinking! ^_^ Shanshad ",5

1170,"Like the famously smoky Lapsang Souchong, Oolong tea comes from mist-enshrouded Wuyi Mountains in the northwestern corner of China's Fujian Province (north of Guangdong [Canton] Province), whose greatest tourist draw besides its mountains is its coast line on the Taiwan Straits, and where tea has been grown at least since the Sung Dynasty (AD 960 - 1279).In terms of production, Oolong tea takes a middle position between the fully fermented black teas (Darjeeling, Assam, Ceylon, Kenya, Lapsang Souchong, etc.) and the unfermented green teas (Sencha, Maccha, Gyokuro, Hougicha/Hojicha, Gunpowder Green), in that it is part-fermented or ""brown"" tea. Its long, dark leaves' fermentation is stopped when they are about 30% red and 70% green, after which they are rubbed to promote their aroma and texture and then dried over charcoal.Ti Quan (Kuan) Yin Oolong takes its name from the Goddess of Mercy (Quan Yin), whose statues can often be found in front of Buddhist temples. Quan Yin is a bodhisattva, i.e. a person who has earned the right to leave this world of misery and enter nirvana, but who has volunteered to stay on earth and assist others in their quest for enlightenment. Legend has it that in a village whose temple was adorned by an iron (""ti"") statue of the goddess, one night Quan Yin appeared in a local farmer's dream and guided him to a cave behind the temple. There, she told him, he would find a treasure he was to tend and share with others. The treasure he did find when he went to the cave the very next morning turned out to be a small tea plant, which he took home and nursed. When it had grown to its full size, its leaves produced this particularly aromatic tea with the delicate fragrance of fruits and spices and a rich, golden color. As he had been bidden by the goddess, the farmer shared it with his neighbors, and he also dedicated it to Quan Yin in grateful appreciation of her gift.Goddess of Mercy Oolong makes for a great refreshment at any time of day and also goes well with meals. It can be enjoyed with or without milk (or cream), and its leaves will even yield a second cup when re-infused. ",5
